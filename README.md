# MostWanted

This project called for our group to build a logical user interface using alerts and prompts to search a provided data set of fictional people by specific criteria.
Users were expected to be able to search for/filter through persons in the data set by 5 or more criteria. We coded this project to ensure that a user could view all
of the information listed in the data set by way of our searching application. This also included a menu offering the option of looking up the fictional persons family
and descendants.
